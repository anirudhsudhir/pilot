Containers from scratch

Inspired by Liz Rice's [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=8fi7uSYlOdc)

## Usage

Note: This application compiles and run on Linux only.

Start the container

```sh
  sudo make
```

### Additional

- Build the sample root filesystem

Note: This step requires docker

```sh
  make rootfs
```

- Remove the root-fs

```sh
  make clean
```
